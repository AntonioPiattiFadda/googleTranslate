This is a React application that allows users to instantly translate words and phrases using the Google Translate API. It is built using React, useReducer for state management, Typescript for type safety, a debounce function for efficient API calls, and CSS for styling.

## Features

- Translate words and phrases: Enter a word or phrase in the input field and get an instant translation in the desired target language.
- Language selection: Choose the source and target languages from a list of supported languages.
- Debouncer: The application uses a debounce function to optimize API calls and ensure efficient performance.
- Copy and Speak functions: Copy the translated text to the clipboard or listen to the translation using text-to-speech.
